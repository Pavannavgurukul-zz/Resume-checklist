### 3. Structure wise your resume should be awesome- all blocks should be aligned and all in the same font and font size.
### 4. We should make our resume international- everything should be like international address and phone numbers also don't write your pin code just write the state and country name.
### 5. Write the phone number in the international format and a separate line and do the same with the email address.
### 6. Keep your resume neat and clean don’t put a single comma or character without use.
